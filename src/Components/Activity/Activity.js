                <h4>Question : How Does react work ?</h4>
                <p>Answer :ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.</p>
                <h4>Question : Diffrences between Props vs State ?</h4>
                <p>Answer : Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components. The this.setState property is used to update the state values in the component.</p>
                <h4>Question : Whats are used istead of useEffect ?</h4>
                <p>Answer : There are two React hooks, useEffect and useLayoutEffect, that appear to work pretty much the same.But theyâ€™re not quite the same. Read on for what makes them different and when to use each. </p>
